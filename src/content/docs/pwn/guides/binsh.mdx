This guide shows you how to find or add a `/bin/sh` string to a program during execution.

This is useful to perform ROP attacks.

## Locating `/bin/sh`
It is possible that `/bin/sh` may already exist as a string in your program. Run `strings -tx ./vuln | grep "/bin/sh"` to check.

If such string exists, it will output the address of the string:
```
XXXXXXXX /bin/sh
```

You can then simply use this address for your payload.

If no strings exist, continue reading to add your own string.

## Locate empty space for `/bin/sh`
If there is no `/bin/sh` string, you will need to add the string yourself to empty address.

To begin, first find some empty space within the program's address space.
1. Open the program with pwndbg.
2. Ensure that the program pauses as it runs, either through a user input or breakpoint you added.
3. Run the program and `CTRL+C` when you are at the pause
4. Run `vmmap`. Identify the address where the `DATA` "region" starts.
5. View the data region with `x/<number of bytes>x <address>` to view some amount of bytes from the target address onwards, inclusive of the target address.
6. Note down the address you want to add `/bin/sh` into. It should be empty `0x00000000` such that you would not interfere with the program.

## Identify "mov" gadget
Afterward, identify a `mov` gadget that you will use.

For example, the gadget `mov qword ptr [rax], rdi; ret` would move the value from `$rdi` to the address at `$rax`.

Note down the address of the `mov` gadget you will use.

## Build payload
You will need to do the following in your payload in no particular order:
1. Set the register that should hold the value to the value
    - Ensure that the `/bin/sh` string contains the null byte like a string should have.
2. Set the register that should hold the address to the address

Finally, call the `mov` gadget via the address you noted down. Here is an example payload:
```python
payload = b"A"*64
payload += p64(rop.rax.address)
payload += p64(b"/bin/sh\x00")
payload += p64(rop.rdi.address)
payload += p64(BINSH)
payload += p64(MOV_GADGET) # mov qword ptr [rax], rdi; ret
```

You can now use the address within your payload for ROP attacks.
