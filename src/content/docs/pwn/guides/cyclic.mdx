title: How to find offsets to return addresses
---
This guide shows you how to find an offset between a buffer and the return address in a stack.

## Identify vulnerable code
To begin, you want to find code that is susceptible to **buffer overflows**.

Examples include:
- `gets()`
- `fgets()` reading more bytes than the buffer size

## Determine architecture
Launch `pwndbg`. Check whether the program is 32-bit or 64-bit with `checksec`.

Here's rough guideline for checking whether an architecture is 32-bit or 64-bit:
- If it has `64` within the name, it's probably 64-bit.
- Otherwise, it's probably a 32-bit.
- Search online if you're unsure.

## Generate cyclic pattern
If the program is 32-bit, run:
```shell
cyclic <length>
```

If the program is 64-bit, run:
```shell
cyclic -n 8 <length>
````

The length determines how long the cyclic pattern string will be. It's best to generate an unnecessarily long string, like `500`.

## Run and Paste the cyclic pattern
Run the program. When the program unsafely asks for your input, enter in your cyclic pattern. This will crash the program.

## Analyze crash report
`pwndbg` will output a crash report. Note down the value of the return address:
- If you see `0x?????? <????+??> ret <0x123456>`, the return address is `0x123456`.
- If you see `Invalid address 0x123456`, the return address is `0x123456`.

## Calculate offset
Feed the return address back into `cyclic` to calculate the offset.

If the program is 32-bit, run:
```shell
cyclic -l <address>
```

If the program is 64-bit, run:
```shell
cyclic -n 8 -l <address>
````

If successful, it will output the offset:
```
Finding cyclic pattern of X bytes: b'????' (hex: 0x????????)
Found at offset X
```
