Welcome to the first tutorial. In this tutorial, we will go through solving Pwn's easiest category, Buffer Overflows.

## Beginning
To begin, let's download the program we will be hacking in this tutorial.

<LinkCard title="tutorial-1" href={tutorial1} description={"Program for Tutorial 1"}/>

Now, let's run the program. Open up a terminal and run the following command.
```bash
./tutorial-1
```

<Aside type="tip">
    Getting this error in your terminal?

    ```bash
    zsh: permission denied: ./tutorial-1
    ```

    This is due to your file having insufficient permissions. (add reference here) To fix this, run the following
    command:
    ```bash
    chmod +x tutorial-1
    ```

    Afterward, try running the program again.

You should see the following appear:
```
Welcome to Tutorial 1! If you're seeing this, this means you have successfully ran the program.
Press enter to continue..
```

It means that you have successfully run the program. Now, let's get started hacking this program.

## Task 1
Here is a snippet of the source code for task 1. Let's take a look at the first line of code.

<Code code={task1} mark={2} lang="c" title={"task-1.c"}/>

<Aside type="note">
    In C, there are no string classes. Instead, strings are represented as an array of characters.

    Arrays that are replaced with user input, like `hackme`, are commonly called "buffers".

    Notice that the array `hackme` has a length of 11, even though `"helloworld"` is 10 characters long.
    This is because strings have an additional character at the end, called the `NULL` character. (insert explaination)
</Aside>

Try changing `hackme` to `"hacked"`.

You may notice that `hackme` wasn't completely changed! The ending part of `"helloworld"` will still be present.
Simply put, the `"hacked"` string you sent (including the `NULL` character) only replaced what it needed to, and the other characters remain untouched.

## Task 2

Here is the snippet for task 2.

<Code code={task2} lang="c" title={"task-2.c"}/>

We've seen what happens if you enter too little characters, but what happens if you enter too much?

Try changing `changeme` to `"pwnedlol"`.

    <summary>Possible answer (Click to reveal)</summary>
    Note that this is not the only answer! The `"A"`'s can be replaced with anything, as long as there is 7 characters
    exactly.

    `AAAAAAApwnedlol`
</details>

Notice that even though the code only intended for you to change `"hackme"`, as highlighted here:
<Code code={task2} mark={10} lang="c" title={"task-2.c"}/>

You managed to change `"changeme"` anyway, since it was "next to" `"hackme"` in the program's memory, known as the [call stack](/pwn/explanations/stack).

These types of exploits are called **"Buffer Overflows"**. They are the very foundation for most attacks later on.
