Welcome to the first tutorial. In this tutorial, we will go through solving Pwn's easiest category, Buffer Overflows.

To begin, let's download the program we will be hacking in this tutorial.

(file)

Now, let's run the program. Open up a terminal and run the following command.
```bash
./tutorial-1
```

<Aside type="tip">
    Getting this error in your terminal?

    ```bash
    zsh: permission denied: ./tutorial-1
    ```

    This is due to your file having insufficient permissions. (add reference here) To fix this, run the following command:
    ```bash
    chmod +x tutorial-1
    ```

    Afterward, try running the program again.

You should see the following appear:
```
Welcome to Tutorial 1! If you're seeing this, this means you have successfully ran the program.
Press enter to continue..
```

It means that you have successfully run the program. Now, let's get started hacking this program.
