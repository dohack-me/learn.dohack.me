The call stack is a region in the RAM that stores "stack frames".

The call stack operates the same as a regular stack: The last element inserted is the first one popped.
This is also known as Last In First Out (LIFO).

When functions are called, new "stack frames" are inserted into the stack.

As elements are added into the call stack, the stack "grows" towards lower addresses.
The newest element has the lowest address.

The stack "starting address" is determined by the compiler.

Usually, addresses of elements in the stack are referred to by its relative to something.
In this case, `X` refers to the "starting address" of the stack.

## Stack frames
A stack frame is like a "section" in the call stack that stores data about active function calls.

When a function is called, the function's stack frame is added into the stack.
When the function returns (that is, it finishes), the stack frame is removed.

The stack frame contains the following items in this order:
1. Function Arguments
2. Function Return Address
 - Where the program should jump to at the end of the function.
 - Typically, this would be a pointer to a function.
3. Function Base Pointer
4. Local Variables

The data is stored in hexadecimal, in 4 or 8 bit long bytes, for 32-bit and 64-bit programs respectively.

### Example
For example, consider the following source code:

<Code code={stack_frames} lang="c" title={"stack-frames-1.c"}/>

This would be how the call stack changes as the program executes.

<Image src={stack_frames_image}
       alt={"A diagram visualizing how the call stack evolves with stack frames being added and removed over time"}/>

When `func1()` was called, its stack frame was added into the call stack.
When `func1()` returned, its stack frame was removed.
