The call stack is a region in the RAM that stores "stack frames".

The call stack operates the same as a regular stack: The last element inserted is the first one popped.
This is also known as Last In First Out (LIFO).

When functions are called, new "stack frames" are inserted into the stack.

## Stack frames
A stack frame stores data about active function calls, including:
- Parameters of called function
- Local variable data
- Return address
    - Where the program should jump to at the end of the function.
    - Typically, this would be a pointer to a function.

The data is stored in hexadecimal, in 4 or 8 bit long bytes, for 32-bit and 64-bit programs respectively.

## Layout

A stack frame has this layout:
1. ...

For example, consider the following source code:

<Code code={stack_frames} lang="c" title={"stack-frames.c"}/>
