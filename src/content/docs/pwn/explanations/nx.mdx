title: NX Bit
---
NX Bit, (no-execute bit) is a CPU feature that properly separates program instructions and user data in the program's address space.

Operating systems that support the NX Bit will also mark the user data "region" as non-executable,
preventing the CPU from executing any instructions within the user data "region".
