title: NX Bit

import {LinkCard} from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

NX Bit, (no-execute bit) is a CPU feature that properly separates program instructions and user data in the program's address space,
the section of RAM allocated to the program.

Operating systems that support the NX Bit will also mark the user data "region" as non-executable,
preventing the CPU from executing any instructions within the user data "region".

## Bypasses
There is no way to negate the protections that the NX Bit provides.

Instead, we should work around it by getting the program to run instructions already within the program.
These attacks are called return oriented programing (ROP) attacks.
