title: Virtual Address Space
---
Virtual Address Space (VAS) is the range of addresses the operating systems makes available to a running program.

As the word "virtual" suggests, the addresses provided to the program is not the actual addresses in the RAM.
Instead, each virtual address is mapped to an actual address in the RAM.

Addresses referring to the VAS are called **"virtual addresses"**.
Addresses referring to the RAM are called **"physical addresses"**.

The mapping between virtual addresses and physical addresses are stored in a table called the **"page table"** within the RAM.

The operating system is responsible for creating, maintaining and destroying page tables.

A VAS may not map to consecutive real addresses in the RAM.
That is to say, two consecutive addresses in the VAS may map to consecutive addresses in the RAM.
