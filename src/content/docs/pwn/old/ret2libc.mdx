title: Return To Libc
---
Return To Libc (ret2libc) is a ROP attack.

ret2libc involves trying to call `system(char* command)` from Libc.

You will still need a `$rdi` gadget and a `ret` gadget.

This attack can mainly be classified into two parts:

- Leaking libc address
- Returning to `libc.system()`

## Leaking libc address
Libc may begin at any random address, where functions of libc will be +X bytes from libc's base address.

One way to leak libc's base address is to call `puts@plt(puts@got)` to find `libc.puts()` address, where then the base address is `libc.puts() - libc.sym["puts"]`.

Achieve this by having this ROP chain:
- `pop_rdi gadget`
- `exe.got["puts"]`
- `exe.plt["puts"]`
- `exe.sym["main"]`
    - Or any another appropriate function. You need the program to continue running after you have leaked the address.

Then, get the address of `libc.puts()` and set libc's base address with:

```python
libc_puts = u64(proc.recvline().strip(b"\n")+b"\x00\x00"
libc.address = libc_puts - libc["puts"]
```

## Returning to libc.system()

By default, libc has a `/bin/sh` string located somewhere within it. We will need to set `$rdi` to the pointer to this string, then call `libc.system()` to get a shell.

Achieve this by having this ROP chain:

- `pop_rdi gadget`
- `next(libc.search(b"/bin/sh"))`
- `ret gadget`
    - something something stack alignment error. basically, have this in 64 bit binaries or program will crash lol
- `libc.sym["system"]`
