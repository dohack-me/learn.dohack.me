title: Position Independent Executable
---
Position Independent Executable (PIE) is a defense that causes every function's address to be offset by X when running. This means that you won't be able to find any function address, like `exe.sym["win"]` until this is bypassed.

To bypass, you will need to find the base offset during runtime. Afterward, set the base address with `exe.address = 0xabcdabcd`

One way to bypass is to find any function's address. Afterward, the programs base must be `exe.address = leaked address - exe.sym["leaked"]`.

It is important to note that previous objects created by pwntools will not change upon the base address being set. That means that you should create any objects depending on your program after setting the base address. Same also applies to your payloads.

```python
rop = ROP(exe)
payload = exe.sym["win"]
exe.address = ...
# rop and payload variable will not work!
```
