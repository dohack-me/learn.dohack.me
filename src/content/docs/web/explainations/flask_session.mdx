In Flask, developers can store key-value pairs in a dictionary object from the Flask library called `session`.
This `session` dictionary will be persisted between user sessions.

In the background, these values are signed and stored as a cookie called `session`.
In a way, this is Flask's version of JWTs.

<LinkCard title="JSON Web Tokens (JWT)" href="/web/explanations/jwt/"/>

The session cookie is signed using `app.secretkey`.

## Example
Consider the following code:
```python
from flask import session

@app.route('/')
def index():
    if "username" in session:
        return f'Welcome back, {session["username"]}'
    session["username"] = "guest"
    return f"Hello there, {session["username"]}"
```
When a user visits the website for the first time, they will receive a new cookie called `session`.
The session cookie contains a signed and serialized version of a JSON containing the session data.
In this case, the JSON might look like this:
```json
{
  "username": "guest"
}
```

Finally, the website will return:
```
Hello there, guest
```

Once the user revisits the website, the `session` dictionary will contain the `"username"` key-value pair stored earlier.
The website will then return:
```
Welcome back, guest
```

## Bypass
As mentioned earlier, the `session` cookie is signed using `app.secretkey`.
If the app's secret key is leaked, you can recreate your own session cookie with your own data.
